TeamSelector
============

A web app designed to manage teams made in ASP.NET C# MVC4.

Allows a user to add, for example, 4 electricians and 5 labourers then add jobs which require X amount of each. 
The application then sorts out which electricians/labourers are available to work the job and whether or not the user
needs to call out for extra labourers etc.
